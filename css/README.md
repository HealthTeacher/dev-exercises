Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project.

I have submitted 2 versions, one with the required functionality based on the animated gif provided, and one with some slightly different animation styles, just for fun.

index.html - basic demo based on gif
index_alt.html - alternate animation styles (just for fun)

I used SCSS, source files are attached
I also combined the SVGs into an SVG sprite to reduce HTTP requests
