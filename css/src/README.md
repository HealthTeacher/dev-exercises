The practice was first created at Codepen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/lianliu/pen/yYGVPx.

This is the tech interview code for GoNoodle.

The following is a simple log of the practice. It takes me 5 days to complete. 

First day, I set up the basic layout for the practice and asked some questions about the fonts and animation on the mockup. 

Second day, I received the reply from the interviewer. He gave some details about what I want. What's more, I found out that the practice became more complicated that I need to do some changes on my layout.

Third day, I gave myself a break.

Fourth day, I was stuck at the ripple animation, trying to imitate it in pure CSS but failed. I sent another Email to the interviewer for if I can use JS.

The fifth day, received the reply. And decided to incorporate JS to help doing the animation. The practice was roughly done.

The sixth day, I had to prepared for the exam that was held the next day. I didn't work on the CSS practice. 

The seventh day, no classes, spent day on cross-browser testing. Thanks to the service provided by CrossBrowserTesting.com, which offers online virtual machines for cross-OS, cross-browser testing. And at the end of the day, I submitted the practice.
