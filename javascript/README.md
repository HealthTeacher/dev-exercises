Created lib for handing basic utlities such as null and type checking. Could expand on this work by breaking the utilities out by type and adding to them.

The PhoneNumber object has some basic functionality for sanitizing phone numbers but could be expanded on.

The Leap year object could be converted into a date/time utility with additional functionality.

This pull request gives us some basic functionality that we can build on.
